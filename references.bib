The recent proposals, LIA and OLIA, suffer from either unfriendliness to Single Path TCP~(SPTCP) or unresponsiveness to network changes under certain conditions. The tradeoff between friendliness and responsiveness is inevitable, but Balia judiciously balances this tradeoff based on a new design framework that allows one to systematically explore the design space. Balia has been implemented in the Linux kernel and there are plans to make it available for experimentation.}",

	abstract = "{Providing fault tolerancy is crucial for a growing number of IP-based applications. There exist a lot of proprietary solutions for this problem, but free alternatives are rare.
Currently, the IETF RSerPool working group is standardizing a protocol suite for Reliable Server Pooling, which copes with the challenge of providing high availability by using redundant servers. Servers for the same service are grouped into a server pool. A server in a pool is called pool element (PE), a user of a pool is called pool user (PU). When a PE fails, its PUs simply select another one from the pool and initiates an application-specific failover procedure. This fail-over is supported by the RSerPool protocol suite. Each PE registers at a name server and is then continously supervised by that specific name server. All name servers of an operational scope provide a redundant system for name resolution from pool handles to transport addresses of pool elements to pool users. RSerPool uses SCTP to provide network fault tolerance and address scoping functionality.
The RSPLIB is a prototype implementation of the RSerPool protocol suite, developed under the GNU Public License in cooperation between Siemens and the Computer Networking Technology Group of the University of Essen. It currently runs under Linux, FreeBSD and Darwin.
Our paper covers aspects of designing and implementing highly available applications using RSerPool with our RSPLIB implementation. First, we will give an introduction to the RSerPool protocol suite and an overview of the RSPLIB components. Then, we describe the RSPLIB API, especially focussing on the implementation of pool element and pool user programs to provide high reliability. Furthermore, we show our current implementation status and future plans. This will be followed by a short look on the problems that can arise when the RSerPool architecture is used. Finally, we give an example how RSerPool can be used to realize highly available services. And last but not least, we show how distributed computing architectures can make use of the RSerPool architecture.}",

Such links not only speed up classical best effort applications but also make new applications like video and audio on demand possible. Unlike best effort applications, these new applications have more requirements for network quality of service, especially an assured bandwidth.
Under the assumption that the link to the customer is the main bottleneck, this paper presents a new simple, scalable edge node approach that has been developed in a cooperation between the University of Essen and British Telecom~(BT). It provides a solution to guaranteeing certain flows, while making others the subject of focused packet discards.

At the heart of this new mobility concept is the reliable transport protocol SCTP, with an enhancement for dynamic address reconfiguration. This is described in this paper. A session layer based on the reliable server pooling (RSerPool) protocol suite provides for sessionmonitoring and control. The suggested solution is transparent for applications,requires no changes in the network infrastructure, and is evaluated with a real-world implementation.
Finally, we present first results from the application of this mobility concept to different mobility scenarios. These were obtained from working SCTP and RSerPool implementations that have been developed within our group.}",

While availability is one main aspect of RSerPool, load distribution is another. Since most of the time a server pool system runs without component failures, optimal performance is an extremely important issue for the productivity and cost-efficiency of the system. In this paper, we therefore focus especially on the load distribution performance of RSerPool in scenarios without failures, presenting a quantitative performance comparison of the different load distribution strategies (called pool policies) defined in the RSerPool specifications. Based on the results, we propose some new pool policies providing significant performance enhancements compared to those currently defined in the standards documents.}",

Außerdem wollen wir vorstellen, welche speziellen Funktionalitäten RSerPool bietet um den Nutzen eines Serverpools sowohl für dessen Betreiber als auch für den Anwender zu optimieren: die Möglichkeit zur vollautomatischen Konfiguration von Komponenten und die Festlegung pool-spezifischer Serverauswahlregeln. Diese Funktionalitäten werden wir am Beispiel der Anwendung von RSerPool für Real-Time Distributed Computing verdeutlichen.
Im zweiten Teil unseres Vortrages werden wir auf unsere Open Source Implementation rsplib eingehen. Neben dem Aufbau der einzelnen Komponenten werden wir insbesondere auch interessante Details der Implementation vorstellen und beschreiben, wie wir auftretende Probleme erfolgreich lösen konnten. Insbesondere wollen wir dabei auch unsere gesammelten Erfahrungen beim Erstellen von auf unterschiedlichen Betriebssystemen und Hardware lauffähiger Software vorstellen. Im Anschluß daran wenden wir uns kurz dem API der rsplib zu und zeigen, wie eigene Programme mit dessen Hilfe hochverfügbar gemacht werden können. Neben neuer, direkt auf RSerPool basierender Software, berücksichtigen wir dabei insbesondere auch die Anpassung bestehender Applikationen und stellen Möglichkeiten zur Migration vor. Zum besseren Verständnis werden sämtliche Beschreibungen von Code-Beispielen begleitet.
Zum Abschluß stellen wir noch unsere Beispielanwendung vor, ein System zum verteilten Berechnen von Fraktalgrafiken. Mit diesem System lassen sich die grundlegenden Eigenschaften von RSerPool – welche im ersten Teil des Vortrages vorgestellt wurden -- sehr anschaulich demonstrieren: die Verwaltung dynamischer Pools, Lastverteilung und Failover bei PE-Ausfall.

In our paper, we present an approach to add distance-awareness to the RSerPool architecture, based on features of the SCTP transport protocol. This approach is examined and evaluated by simulations. But to also show its usefulness in real life, we furthermore validate our proposed extension by measurements in a PlanetLab-based Internet scenario.}",

VoIP-Vermittlungsanlagen zur Weiterleitung von Notrufen oder e-Commerce-Anwendungen sind nicht akzeptabel. Zur Sicherstellung der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten bei Geräte- und Netzwerkausfällen müssen diese Komponenten redundant ausgelegt sein. Spezialisierte Redundanzlösungen – insbesondere z.B. für Web-Server – gibt es zwar viele; eine einheitliche, für viele Dienste nutzbare Lösung fehlte jedoch noch. Reliable Server Pooling, abgekürzt RSerPool, ist ein Rahmenwerk zur Bereitstellung hochverfügbarer Anwendungen durch redundante Server; es befindet sich zur Zeit in der Standardisierung durch die IETF RSerPool-Arbeitsgruppe. Im RSerPool-Konzept werden Server, welche den gleichen Dienst anbieten, zu einem Pool zusammengefaßt. Neben der Hauptaufgabe – der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten – ist insbesondere auch die Lastverteilung ein wichtiges Anwendungsgebiet von RSerPool.
Im Rahmen eines Forschungsprojektes haben wir -- die Arbeitsgruppe Technik der Rechnernetze am Institut für Experimentelle Mathematik der Universität Duisburg-Essen -- im Jahre 2002 damit begonnen, einen plattformunabhängigen RSerPool-Prototypen als Open Source unter GPL-Lizenz zu entwickeln. Mittlerweile wird unser Projekt durch die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) gefördert. Unser System läuft zur Zeit unter Linux, FreeBSD, Darwin (MacOS X) und Solaris, wobei die Unterstützung für weitere Plattformen – insbesondere auch für Embedded-Systeme – geplant ist. Als einzige vollständige Implementierung des zukünftigen RSerPool-Standards sind wir Referenzimplementierung der IETF RSerPool-Arbeitsgruppe und wirken mit Tests und Forschungsarbeiten aktiv in der Standardisierung mit.
In unserem Vortrag geben wir zunächst eine kurze Einführung zu RSerPool. Dabei wollen wir insbesondere auch die Merkmale verdeutlichen, die RSerPool von existierenden Lösungen – wie Linux Virtual Server (LVS) oder dem kommerziellen Cisco Distributed Director – unterscheiden. Außerdem wollen wir zeigen, welche speziellen Funktionalitäten RSerPool bietet um den Nutzen eines Serverpools sowohl für dessen Betreiber als auch für den Anwender zu optimieren: die Möglichkeit zur vollautomatischen Konfiguration von Komponenten und die Festlegung pool-spezifischer Serverauswahlregeln. Diese Funktionalitäten werden wir am Beispiel einer Anwendung von RSerPool für Real-Time Distributed Computing verdeutlichen.
Im zweiten Teil unseres Vortrags werden wir auf unsere Open Source Implementierung rsplib eingehen. Neben dem Aufbau der einzelnen Komponenten werden wir insbesondere auch interessante Details der Implementierung vorstellen und beschreiben, wie wir auftretende Probleme erfolgreich lösen konnten. Insbesondere wollen wir dabei auch unsere gesammelten Erfahrungen beim Erstellen von auf unterschiedlichen Betriebssystemen (Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, Solaris) und Hardware (x86, x64, PPC) lauffähiger Software vorstellen. Im Anschluß daran zeigen wir, wie das RSerPool-API dazu genutzt werden kann, eigene Anwendungen hochverfügbar zu machen und die Möglichkeiten zur Lastverteilung im Pool verwendet werden können. Ein Schwerpunkt dieser Einführung wird dabei insbesondere die einfache und effiziente Realisierung des Failover-Mechanisms sein, d.h. des Verfahrens zur Wiederherstellung eines Sitzungszustandes auf einem neuen Server nach Ausfall des alten. Im Besonderen werden wir dabei zeigen, welche Fähigkeiten RSerPool und sein API mitbringen um dieses – teilweise recht komplexe Thema – in vielen Fällen übersichtlich und mit wenigen Zeilen Programmcode zu lösen: Hochverfügbarkeit für eigene Anwendungen muß nicht kompliziert sein!
Zum Abschluß stellen wir noch unsere Beispielanwendung vor, ein System zum verteilten Berechnen von Fraktalgrafiken. Mit diesem System lassen sich die grundlegenden Eigenschaften von RSerPool – welche im Vortrag vorgestellt wurden – sehr anschaulich demonstrieren: die Verwaltung dynamischer Pools, Lastverteilung und Failover bei Serverausfall. Selbstverständlich werden wir unser Beispielsystem beim Vortrag auch in der Praxis demonstrieren; bei Vorhandensein eines Internetzugangs sogar mit einem Szenario aus weltweit verteilten Ressourcen.}",

There has already been some research on the server selection strategies of RSerPool for different application scenarios. In particular, it has been shown that the adaptive Least Used selection usually provides the best performance. This strategy requires up-to-date load information of the services, which has to be propagated among distributed pool management components. But network delay (which is realistic for systems being widely distributed to achieve availability in case of regional servers failures) as well as caching of information may both lead to obsolete load information.

To support the development and operation of such applications, the IETF has recently defined a new standard for a common server redundancy and session failover framework: Reliable Server Pooling~(RSerPool). The basic ideas of the RSerPool framework are not entirely new, but their combination into a single, resource-efficient and unified architecture is. Service availability achieved by the redundancy of servers directly leads to the issues of load distribution and load balancing, which are both important for the performance of RSerPool systems. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the performance of such systems with respect to the load balancing strategy required by the service application.
In this article -- which is an extended version of our paper~[1] -- we first present an overview of the RSerPool architecture with a focus on the component failure detection and handling mechanisms. We will also shortly introduce the underlying SCTP protocol and its link redundancy features. After that, we will present a quantitative, application-independent performance analysis of the failure detection and session failover mechanisms provided by RSerPool, with respect to important adaptive and non-adaptive load balancing strategies.}",

But since the protocols of the classical Internet -- particularly TCP -- assume a single access path only, the number of programs supporting multiple network paths is still small. The Stream Control Transport Protocol~(SCTP), which is an advanced general-purpose transport protocol and the possible successor of TCP, brings the support of multi-homing into the applications.
For technical reasons, SCTP uses one network path for data transmission and utilizes the other paths for backup only. An extension to support the load balancing of user data onto multiple paths in order to increase the payload throughput is Concurrent Multipath Transfer for SCTP, denoted as CMT-SCTP. In this paper, we describe our CMT-SCTP extension for the SCTP~model provided by the INET framework.

The idea of Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT) is to exploit the existence of multiple paths among endpoints to increase application data throughput. However, handling the congestion control of each path independently lacks of fairness against non-CMT flows.
In this paper, we describe our approach of combining CMT with the idea of Resource Pooling~(RP) in order to achieve a performance improvement over non-CMT transfer while still remaining fair to concurrent flows on congested links. Unlike existing approaches which adapt classic TCP to a multi-homed CMT protocol, our approach does not depend on specific characteristics of TCP. Instead, we base on already entrenched functional blocks of CMT transfer, on the example of the CMT-enabled SCTP~(Stream Control Transmission Protocol). In a simulative proof-of-concept analysis, we show that our approach -- while relatively simple -- is already quite effective.}",

Grid Computing provides powerful -- but also highly complex -- mechanisms to realize such tasks. Also, there is a steadily growing number of downtime-critical applications, requiring redundant servers to ensure service availability in case of component failures.
To cope with the demand for server redundancy and service availability, the IETF has recently standardized the lightweight Reliable Server Pooling~(RSerPool) framework, which is a common architecture for server pool and session management. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of RSerPool and then present the modeling thoughts of RSPLIB and the underlying general groupware design. Based on RSPLIB, we will illustratively show how to easily develop applications on top of RSerPool. We will also offer an application evaluation example for a proof-of-concept setup to distribute ray-tracing computation workload into a compute pool.}",

In this paper, we propose our approach for breaking up the functionalities of the OSI Transport Layer into the concept so called functional building blocks. Each functional building block provides a particular service, which -- in interaction with the other functional building blocks -- is able to provide a service similar to the classic OSI Transport Layer. The concept allows for easy removal, replacement or addition of existing and new functional building blocks to adapt the service to state-of-the-art and future requirements, particularly including multi-path transport and QoS.}",

But the Internet itself is not a good test environment, since its components are not controllable and certain problem situations (like congestion or error conditions) are difficult to reproduce. Various testbeds have been built up to fill this gap. Most of these testbeds also support link emulation, i.e.\ using software to mimic the characteristic behaviour of certain kinds of network links (like bandwidth bottlenecks or error-prone radio transmissions). The most popular link emulation systems are the Linux-based NetEm and Dummynet, which are e.g.\ applied on the IP~layer of Planet-Lab and various other testbeds. However, the restriction to the OSI Network Layer (here:~IP) is insufficient to test new non-IP Future Internet protocols.
In this paper, we first introduce Dummynet and NetEm. After that, we will present our approach of adapting Dummynet for Linux to support link emulation on the Data Link Layer. Finally, we evaluate the applicability and performance of Dummynet and NetEm for link emulation on the Data Link Layer, in a Planet-Lab-based testbed environment. Our goal is to outline the performance and limitations of both approaches in the context of Planet-Lab-based testbeds, in order to make them applicable for the evaluation of non-IP Future Internet protocols.}",

Currently, CMT is a quite hot topic in the IETF -- in form of the Multipath~TCP~(MPTCP) and CMT-SCTP protocol extensions for TCP and SCTP. However, an important issue is still not fully solved: multipath congestion control.
In order to support the IETF activities, we have set up a distributed Internet testbed for CMT evaluation. An important tool -- which we have developed for multi-protocol Transport Layer performance analysis -- is the Open Source 
NetPerfMeter tool-chain. It supports the parametrisation and processing of measurement runs as well as results collection, post-processing and plotting. However, its key feature is to support multiple Transport Layer protocols, which makes a quantitative comparison of different protocols -- including state-of-the-art features like CMT -- possible. In this paper, we first introduce 
NetPerfMeter and then show a proof-of-concept performance evaluation of CMT congestion controls which are currently discussed in the IETF standardisation process of CMT-SCTP.}",

We address the shortcomings of the layered model by redesigning the classical model. Our approach differs from the concepts found in prior work, which focus on special parts of the problems (such as the application, the service or the event) by staggering back a couple of steps and trying to see the requirements from a different perspective. Our concept -- which is denoted as Encapsulated Responsibility-Centric Architecture Model~(ERiCA) -- focuses on determining the responsibilities by using different planes in addition to a partitioning of the network into different decision domains. With this partitioning, we can reduce the complexity of providing a certain service.}",

In consequence, this results in a growing demand for utilising multiple Internet accesses simultaneously, in order to improve application payload throughput during normal operation. Multi-path Transport Layer protocol extensions -- like Multi-Path~TCP~(MPTCP) for TCP and Concurrent Multipath Transfer for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP) -- allow applications to make use of such network topologies.
However, since TCP -- which constitutes the basis of most Internet applications -- and its congestion control procedures have been designed under the assumption of single-homed sites, fairness issues may arise by the usage of multipath transport. These issues are addressed by advanced congestion control approaches, which have already been examined by simulations. However, real-life network measurements are missing. In this paper, we perform an experimental proof-of-concept evaluation of several multipath congestion control strategies, which are currently under discussion within the IETF in the context of MPTCP as well as CMT-SCTP. Particularly, we validate effects that have been observed in simulations, in order to trigger further discussions on multipath congestion control. Also, our goal is to provide insight into the different approaches to support the ongoing IETF standardisation activities on multipath transport protocols.}",

In consequence, there is a rising demand for so-called multi-path transfer, which utilizes all of these interfaces simultaneously in order to maximize the payload throughput of applications. Currently, this so-called multi-path transfer is very actively discussed by the IETF, in form of the Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) extension for TCP as well as the Concurrent Multi-path Transfer extension for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP). Their larger-scale deployment in the Internet is expected for the near future.
A key issue that prevents the standardization of these approaches is the fairness to concurrent TCP flows. A multi-path transfer should behave "TCP-friendly", i.e.\ cause no harm to the performance of the very widely deployed TCP-based applications. In this paper, we first extend the notion of "fairness" from single-path transport to multi-path transport. Furthermore, we introduce the relevant congestion control approaches in the IETF context for single-path as well as multi-path transfer. We simulatively analyze these approaches in a couple of interesting network configuration scenarios, in order to show their behavior with special regard to the fairness definitions. Particularly, we also point out items of further discussion which are the result of the current approaches.}",

While it has originally been built for less critical services like e-mail and file transfer, it is nowadays also increasingly often used for availability-critical services like e.g.\ e-commerce or healthcare. Clearly, the reachability of such services must be ensured by so-called multi-homing of endpoints. That is, endpoints are simultaneously connected to multiple Internet Service Providers~(ISP) to provide redundancy. If one ISP has problems, it is intended that the connection to another one still works. However, such assumptions have never been verified in real, large-scale setups.
The intention of the NorNet project is to build up a realistic Internet testbed for multi-homing. In this paper, we describe the design of NorNet with focus on the implementation of its fixed-line part: NorNet Core. This paper is intended to give researchers an overview of its mode of operation, its capabilities as well as its interesting feature realisations. The knowledge about these items is very useful to plan own experiments in the NorNet testbed.}",

This so-called multi-homing also leads to the desire of utilising multiple network paths simultaneously, in order to improve application payload throughput. Clearly, this so-called multi-path transfer feature is also very useful for the transport of multimedia contents, particularly when a single network access alone is not fast enough to fulfil the bandwidth requirements of the application.
In many cases, multimedia transport is also sensitive for delays and packet losses. However, the focus of the current multi-path transfer approaches has been on bandwidth only. In order to tackle this challenge, our paper introduces two new send strategies to map payload data to different wireless paths.

Nowadays, a large number of important services -- for instance e-commerce, healthcare and many others -- depend on the availability of the underlying network. Clearly, service interruptions due to network problems may have a severe impact. On the long way towards the Future Internet, the complexity will grow even further. Therefore, new ideas and concepts must be evaluated thoroughly, and particularly in realistic, real-world Internet scenarios, before they can be deployed for production networks. For this purpose, various testbeds -- for instance PlanetLab, GpENI or G-Lab -- have been established and are intensively used for research. However, all of these testbeds lack the support for so-called multi-homing.
Multi-homing denotes the connection of a site to multiple Internet service providers, in order to achieve redundancy. Clearly, with the need for network availability, there is a steadily growing demand for multi-homing. The idea of the NorNet Core project is to establish a Future Internet research testbed with multi-homed sites, in order to allow researchers to perform experiments with multi-homed systems. Particular use cases for this testbed include realistic experiments in the areas of multi-path routing, load balancing, multi-path transport protocols, overlay networks and network resilience. In this paper, we introduce the NorNet Core testbed as well as its architecture.}",

These multiple interfaces can be utilized simultaneously by a multi-path transport protocol to provide bandwidth aggregation or reliability. However, in order to design efficient multi-path scheduling and congestion control strategies, it is crucial to understand the behaviour and properties of the underlying paths first. WLAN links have already been studied extensively in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on Mobile Broadband~(MBB) networks that are in use today. We utilized 
NorNet Edge nodes that are connected to up to five different 3G ISPs (UMTS and CDMA2000), hence, providing a realistic view on the QoS characteristics that are experienced by end-users of these MBB networks. We present QoS characteristics (e.g.\ bandwidth, delay and loss) and discuss our observations. Our results shed light on what a multi-path transport endpoint has to expect -- and to efficiently cope with -- when using today's MBB networks as transport paths.}",

A transport protocol can make use of this best effort service to provide a suitable service to its applications. Also, its congestion control is responsible for a fair distribution of the resources within the Internet. However, background data transfer applications (like file sharing or update fetching) do not require "best effort"; they in fact could use a "lower-than-best-effort" service to leave resources to more important applications if needed. For this purpose, the Low Extra Delay Background Transport~(LEDBAT) algorithm has been standardized by the IETF.
Nowadays, multi-homing is becoming increasingly common in modern networks and several approaches to exploit this feature (e.g.\ CMT-SCTP, MPTCP) have evolved that are able to combine resources of multiple paths. For background traffic oriented algorithms like LEDBAT, this feature could be of great use, too, i.e.\ by increasing the overall bandwidth while shifting the transmission away from paths which are used by other flows. This could be particularly useful for non-critical bulk transfers in data centres. In this paper, we introduce our approach LEDBAT for Multi-Path -- denoted as LEDBAT-MP -- and analyze its performance by simulations. With this paper, we want to highlight some generic design questions and start a discussion on how a solid universal background multi-path congestion control strategy should behave.}",

Besides the redundancy aspect, multi-homing can also make load sharing by multi-path transport possible, i.e.\ increasing the application throughput by utilising multiple paths simultaneously. Multi-path transport can e.g.\ be realised by Concurrent Multi-Path Transfer for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP) and Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP), two protocols that are currently under standardisation in the IETF.
The growing need for and deployment of multi-homed applications makes large-scale testing and evaluation in realistic Internet setups necessary.

In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed monitoring system with Sensor nodes located in Norway, Germany and China that allow to detect SIP-based attacks from the Internet. Based on experiences from experiments spanning several years, we propose a new setup which allows simple and straightforward addition of new remote observation points. We have deployed this setup in the NorNet testbed and highlight its advantages compared to a previous setup with physically distributed Sensors. We also present results from a 45~day field test with 13 observation points. These results confirm the advantages of a widely distributed monitoring setup and give some new insights into the behavior of the attackers.}",

Although the idea of using multiple interfaces simultaneously to improve application throughput is tempting, does transmission over multiple interfaces always provide benefits especially in realistic setup? In this paper, we first show that multi-path transfer might actually have a negative impact in real-world scenarios with mobile broadband and wireless LAN networks. We then introduce our Dynamic Relative Path Scoring (DRePaS) algorithm that continuously evaluates the contribution of paths to the overall performance and dynamically influences the scheduling decisions to make best use of the paths for the overall system performance. We show that DRePaS outperforms the current MPTCP implementation in terms of throughput and application delay, especially when the links are heterogeneous.}",

Not so many Internet service providers offer direct IPv6 connectivity to their customers, yet. Clearly, when IPv6 is available to customers, they expect that IPv6 offers at least the same -- or even better -- stability of connections in comparison to IPv4. The main goal of this paper is to investigate whether this is true today.
In our paper, we present up-to-date measurement results on the stability of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the real Internet, based on machines that are distributed over a large geographical area, as part of the NorNet Core testbed infrastructure for multi-homed systems. The measurements not only cover high-speed research networks, but also consumer-grade ADSL connections -- i.e. the ISP connection types of "normal" end-users -- as well as a broad range of different ISPs. The measurements show that IPv6 paths are less stable than corresponding IPv4 paths. We also find that the use of load balancing is more prevalent in IPv6 than in IPv4.}",

We find that the IPv6 network is maturing, albeit slowly. While most core Internet transit providers have deployed IPv6, edge networks are lagging. Early IPv6 network deployment was stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. Current IPv6 network deployment still shows the same pattern. The IPv6 topology is characterized by a single dominant player -- Hurricane Electric -- which appears in a large fraction of IPv6 AS paths, and is more dominant in IPv6 than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing dynamics in the IPv6 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4, and churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the underlying topologies. Our measurements suggest that performance over IPv6 paths is comparable to that over IPv4 paths if the AS-level paths are the same, but can be much worse than IPv4 if the AS-level paths differ.}",

As RIRs have started rationing allocations, IPv4 transfer markets have emerged as a new mechanism to acquire IPv4 addresses. Barring a few high-profile exceptions, IPv4 transfers have largely flown under the radar. In this work, we use the lists of transfers published by three RIRs to characterize the transfer market - the types of players involved, the sizes and characteristics of transferred address blocks, and visible effects on the routing table. Next, we take first steps toward detecting address transfers using BGP data from the Routeviews and RIPE repositories from 2004-2013. We identify reasons why legitimate changes in prefix origin could be confused as transfers, and implement a series of 10 filters that remove 86\% of candidate transfers. We find the remaining number of inferred transfers is increasing over time. We could confirm few (0.16\%) of these transfers using RIR-published transfer lists; while our inference methodology undoubtedly yields false positives, a black market for IPv4 transfers may exist as well.}",

We first design and implement a generic modular scheduler framework that enables testing of different schedulers for Multipath TCP. We then use this framework to do an in-depth analysis of different schedulers by running experiments on a emulator and a testbed. We consider bulk data transfer as well as application limited traffic and identify metrics to quantify the scheduler's performance. Our results shed light on how scheduling decisions can help to improve multipath transfer.}",

NorNet Edge consists of a large number of dedicated hardware nodes connected to all mobile broadband providers in Norway. The nodes are based on cheap commodity hardware and run a full Linux-distribution, allowing full flexibility in designing and performing measurements. Custom-made software in the nodes automatically detects and configures the network subsystem based on available networks, making them especially well suited for mobile broadband measurements. The software is based on commonly available functionality and is easy to port to different hardware architectures or operating systems. In this paper, we present the architecture and functional goals of NorNet Edge, evaluate important performance aspects of the hardware nodes, and present results from an illustrative measurement experiment.}",

	abstract = "{Aggregate Server Access Protocol~(ASAP; RFC 5352), in conjunction with the Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol~(ENRP; RFC 5353), provides a high-availability data transfer mechanism over IP networks. ASAP uses a handle-based addressing model that isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es), which normally constitutes a single point of failure.
 In addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a pool, providing full transparent support for server pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability -- members of a server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting the service.
 ASAP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol~(SCTP; RFC 4960). Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST have an accompanying transport mapping document. It should be noted that ASAP messages passed between Pool Elements~(PEs) and ENRP servers MUST use the SCTP transport protocol.
 The high-availability server pooling is gained by combining two protocols, namely ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user interface for Pool Handle to address translation, load sharing management, and fault management, while ENRP defines the high- availability Pool Handle translation service. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.}",

	abstract = "{This document presents results from the survey to gather information from people who have implemented MPTCP, in particular to help progress the protocol from Experimental to Standards track. The document currently includes answers from four teams: a Linux implementation from UCLouvain, a FreeBSD implementation from Swinburne, an anonymous implementation in a commercial OS, and a NetScalar Firmware implementation from Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank- you! In summary, we have four independent implementations of all the MPTCP signalling messages, with the exception of address management, and some interoperabiity testing has been done by the other three implementations with the 'reference' Linux implementation. So it appears that the RFC is~(at least largely) clear and correct. On address management, we have only one implementation of ADD_ADDR with two teams choosing not to implement it. We have one implementation of the working group's coupled congestion control~(RFC6356) and none of the MPTCP-aware API~(RFC6897). The main suggested improvements are around o how MPTCP falls back~(if the signalling is interrupted by a middlebox):~(1) corner cases that are not handled properly,~(2) at the IETF, the MPTCP community should work with middlebox vendors, either to reduce or eliminate the need for fallback or to understand the middlebox interactions better. o security: both better MPTCP security~(perhaps building on SSL) and a lighter weight mechanism, preferably both in one mechanism. It is hoped that the next version can include information from any other implementations. If you are an implementer and want to contribute your answers, please see the -01 version of this document for a blank survey ready to be filled in.}",

The data transport is augmented by a control protocol~(RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.

In particular, we note that alternative experimental proposals are likely to be forthcoming, and it is not well understood how the proposals in this document will interact with such alternative proposals. This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments. For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets~(or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours). This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint.

	abstract = "{Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but communications are usually restricted to a single path per connection. Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP.
 New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property called "resource pooling" where a bundle of links effectively behaves like one shared link with bigger capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency of the network and also its robustness to failure.
 This document presents a congestion control algorithm that couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.}",

Since delivery of a SACKed out-of-order DATA chunk is not guaranteed, a copy of this DATA chunk MUST be kept in the data sender's retransmission queue until this DATA chunk is cumulatively acked. By definition, data that has been delivered to the application is non-renegable by the SCTP data receiver. ~(Recall that, in SCTP, out- of-order data can sometimes be delivered.) Also, SCTP implementations can be configured such that the SCTP data receiver is not allowed to, and therefore, never reneges on out-of-order data. With SCTP's current SACK mechanism, non-renegable out-of-order data is selectively acked, and is~(wrongly) deemed renegable by the SCTP data sender.

NR-SACKs enable a data receiver to explicitly inform the data sender of non-renegable out-of-order data.

In addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a pool, providing full transparent support for server-pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability -- members of a server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting the service. ASAP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol~(SCTP) [RFC4960]. Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST have an accompanying transport mapping document. It should be noted that ASAP messages passed between PE's and ENRP servers MUST use the SCTP transport protocol. The high availability server pooling is gained by combining two protocols, namely ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user interface for pool handle to address translation, load sharing management, and fault management while ENRP defines the high availability pool handle translation service.}",

Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property called resource pooling where a bundle of links effectively behaves like one shared link with bigger-capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm which couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links.}",

	abstract = "{The Stream Control Transmission Protocol~(SCTP) as defined in RFC~4960 is an advanced Transport Layer protocol that provides support for multi-homing. That is, SCTP endpoints may simultaneously use multiple Network Layer addresses, which allows to connect the endpoints to multiple networks for redundancy purposes. However, for the transfer of user data, only one of the possible paths is currently used at a time. All other paths remain as backup and are only used for retransmissions.
Clearly, the existence of multiple paths has led to the idea of applying load sharing among the paths. An extension to SCTP -- denoted as Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT) -- realises this load sharing functionality. While this approach works well for similar paths, i.e.\ paths having similar characteristics regarding bandwidths, bit error rates and delays, the use of dissimilar paths does not work that neatly.
In this thesis, the issues of dissimilar paths for CMT-based load sharing will be demonstrated first. The reasons for these issues will be identified and solutions proposed. These solutions will be evaluated in simulations, as well as partially also in a real-world Internet testbed setup, in order to show their effectiveness. In particular, it will be shown that a combination of multiple mechanisms is necessary to make CMT work as expected under a wide range of network and system parameters.
Furthermore, the fairness of CMT-based transport -- in concurrency to classic non-CMT flows -- will be analysed. The usage of plain CMT leads to an overly aggressive bandwidth occupation on so-called shared bottlenecks. As a countermeasure, the idea of Resource Pooling will be utilised. For this purpose, two new and one adapted congestion control approach -- all based on the Resource Pooling principle -- will be introduced and examined in similar as well as dissimilar path setups, in order to show how to fairly deploy CMT transport in the Internet.
The results of this work have also been contributed to the ongoing IETF~standardisation process of SCTP and its extensions.}",

Dienste werden mittels eines geschichteten, hierarchischen Protokollstacks realisiert, bei welchem eine Interaktion nicht-benachbarter Schichten nicht vorgesehen ist. Dieser starre Aufbau macht bereits das Anpassen der Internet-Architektur an die Anforderungen der heutigen Anwendungen – wie etwa File Sharing, Videotelefonie und mobile Endgeräte – kompliziert. Die großen Herausforderungen des zukünftigen Internets – welches als das Future Internet bezeichnet wird – mit Anwendungsszenarien wie Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Sensornetzwerken und vielen weiteren – erfordern jedoch noch weitaus umfangreichere Anpassungen. Zudem ist eine große Flexibilität erforderlich, um auch weiteren – heute noch nicht absehbaren – Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.
Im Rahmen dieses Habilitationsvortrages wird zunächst kurz auf die Probleme des aktuellen Internets eingegangen sowie die Herausforderungen des Future Internets vorgestellt. Im Anschluss daran wird eine Auswahl der für den Übergang zum Future Internet möglichen evolutionären sowie revolutionären Ansätze vorgestellt. Der Schwerpunkt liegt hierbei auf den noch relativ neuen – und in der Forschung momentan sehr aktiv diskutierten – revolutionären Ansätzen, welche mit der Idee des sogenannten Clean Slate einen vollständigen Neuansatz anstreben. Hierbei werden die Ansätze der Funktionalen Komposition, des Content-Centric Networking sowie der Virtualisierung von Netzwerken vorgestellt. Zum Schluss wird dann auf die Frage eingegangen, wie eine Nutzung der vorgestellten Ansätze in der Praxis möglich ist und welche der aktuell in Diskussion befindlichen Ansätze sich in Zukunft voraussichtlich durchsetzen werden.}",

These functionalities as such are not new, but their combination into one generic, application-independent framework is.
Initial goal of this thesis is to gain insight into the complex RSerPool mechanisms by performing experimental and simulative proof-of-concept tests. The further goals are to systematically validate the RSerPool architecture and its protocols, provide improvements and optimizations where necessary and propose extensions if useful. Based on these evaluations, recommendations to implementers and users of RSerPool should be provided, giving guidelines for the tuning of system parameters and the appropriate configuration of application scenarios. In particular, it is also a goal to transfer insights, optimizations and extensions of the RSerPool protocols from simulation to reality and also to bring the achievements from research into application by supporting and contributing relevant results to the IETF's ongoing RSerPool standardization process.
To achieve the described goals, a prototype implementation as well as a simulation model are designed and realized at first. Using a generic application model and appropriate performance metrics, the performance of RSerPool systems in failure-free and server failure scenarios is systematically evaluated in order to identify critical parameter ranges and problematic protocol behaviour. Improvements developed as result of these performance analyses are evaluated and finally contributed into the standardization process of RSerPool.}",

	abstract = "{The Internet is developing with a very high speed. Just a few years ago, its main applications were file transfer and e-mail access, all based on the best effort TCP/IP service over quite slow links. With the quickly growing deployment of high-speed Internet accesses, there is a growing demand for also using the Internet in application scenarios like real-time multimedia streaming, particularly for audio and video on demand services. However, such multimedia applications do not only require sufficient bandwidth. They have stricter quality of service demands, like e.g.\ an upper bound on the transfer delay to ensure interactivity for their users.
In the context of this thesis, a system for the cost-efficient transfer of variable bitrate multimedia streams over Differentiated Services~(DiffServ) is presented and evaluated. This system supports layered transmission, i.e.\ streams may be partitioned into sub-streams denoted as layers (e.g.\ a video layer and an audio layer). Distinct layers may have different priorities as well as quality of service requirements and may therefore use different DiffServ classes for data transmission. Also, the streams may be scalable, i.e.\ the quality of the transferred media may be decreased in order to reduce the bandwidth requirements when bandwidth becomes scarce. Particularly, the system makes use of the fact that media files in e.g.\ a video on demand library can be analyzed a priorily. The information that is computed during the offline analysis is used to realize a dynamic and cost-efficient transport of layer data over different DiffServ classes. Furthermore, the system applies an adaptive buffering to smooth the flows -- in order to save bandwidth -- while also taking care of the delay constraints.}",

Therefore, in this thesis, effects of mobility on MBB performance are studied, and the QoS performance of Norwegian MBB networks under mobility are compared to provide a realistic view of the QoS characteristics experienced by the end-users. For this, performance metrics such as delay, packet loss, connectivity are measured for four operational MBB networks under mobility simultaneously using NorNet Edge (NNE), the dedicated testbed for experimentation and measurements in MBB networks. Measurements in different speed are examined to see how speed affects MBB performance. Radio conditions such as Local Area Code (LAC), Cell Identification (CellID) are also investigated to establish relation between the measured performance and physical locations as well as cell attachment and handover behaviors. Mode and Submode are also observed to see 2G/3G networks coverage and packet distribution in HSPA+, HSDPA, HSUPA, WCDMA and EDGE networks. The results of this thesis show that MBB performance is affected (degraded) by mobility, but degree varies with respect to performance metrics. It was found that MBB operators under mobility perform differently even though the underlying technology is same.}",

A wide literature is existed in many different scenarios concerning the behavior of congestion control algorithms and several congestion control algorithms have been proposed in order to improve performances. WLAN links have already been studied extensively in the literature. In this paper we focus on Mobile Broadband (MBB) networks that are in use today. We used NorNet Edge node which is connected to 3 different 3G ISP{'}s (UMTS and CDMA2000). We also use three different TCP congestion control algorithms: TCP NewReno, TCP CUBIC as loss-based algorithms and TCP Vegas as delay based algorithms and try to see the impact of each TCP congestion control algorithm on the QoS characteristics. In the other word, we want to see how each MBB provider could affect the same TCP connection with same characteristics. We present QoS characteristics (e.g. Goodput, delay) and discuss our observations. Our results could be used later for improvements in multi-path congestion controls.}",

Several studies are going on in order to getting the information about IPv6 which makes a contribution with improvement and deployment of IPv6 and accelerates this transitioning which one of the aspects is the Internet path stability. With this aid this thesis proposed a comparative study of Internet path stability over IPv4 and IPv6. First a measurement of Internet paths over both IP versions has been performed, then the Internet path changes have been extracted in each single set of source-destination pairs. Finally some analysis on the data has been performed in order to observe the stability of Internet paths and provided a comparative study in the set of IPv4 and IPv6.}",

The NorNet Core multi-homed network testbed aims to facilitate this research by offering programmable virtual machines located at multiple different sites across the world, accessible for researchers. The aim of this project is the design and implementation of a demonstration platform for NorNet Core that enables the testbed to be illustratively demonstrated to potential new users. This is done by offering users interactive experiments, and geographical visualization of various communication scenarios between nodes in the NorNet Core network in real time. The demonstration platform puts emphasis on demonstrating the unique aspects of NorNet Core compared to other networking testbeds; namely the multi-homed nature and IPv6 support for all of the nodes. This thesis discusses the technical aspects of designing and implementing the platform, as well as demonstrating the finished result with various demonstration scenarios.

	abstract = "{The explosive deployment of wired and wireless communication infrastructure has recently enabled many novel applications and sparked new research problems. One of the unsolved issues in today’s Internet – the main topic of this thesis – is the goal of increasing data transfer speeds of end hosts by aggregating and simultaneously using multiple network interfaces. This objective is most interesting when the Internet is accessible through several, relatively slow and variable (typically wireless) networks, which are unable to single-handedly provide the required data rate for resource-intensive applications, such as bulk file transfers and high-definition multimedia streaming. Communication devices equipped with multiple network interfaces are now commonplace. Smartphones and laptops are often shipped with built-in network adapters of different wireless technologies, typically enabling them to connect to wireless local area networks and cellular data networks (such as WLAN and HSPA). At the same time, wireless network coverage has become so widespread that mobile devices are often located in overlapping coverage areas of independent access networks. However, even if multiple interfaces are successfully connected to the Internet, operating systems typically use only a single default interface for data transmission, leaving secondary interfaces idle. This technical restriction is based on the fact that the majority of current Internet traffic is conveyed by transport protocols (TCP and UDP) that do not support multiple IP addresses per endpoint. Another crucial factor is that path heterogeneity introduces packet reordering, which can negatively affect the performance of transport protocols and strain the buffer requirements of applications. This thesis explores the problem of multipath aggregation with the attempt to find solutions that achieve increased data throughput by concurrently utilizing heterogeneous and dynamic access networks. We strive for approaches that support existing applications without requiring significant modifications to the current infrastructure. The exploration starts at the IP layer with a study of the IP packet reordering that is caused by the use of heterogeneous paths. Our practical experiments confirm that multipath reordering exceeds the typical packet reordering in the Internet by an extent that renders the usual reordering metric useless. The outcome of our network-layer study is a proxy-based, adaptive multipath scheduler that is able to mitigate packet reordering while transparently forwarding a single transport connection over multiple paths. After introducing a novel metric for quantifying the benefit of path aggregation, our analysis continues on the transport layer, where we investigate TCP’s resilience to multipath-inflicted packet reordering. While IP packet reordering is known for its destructive effect on TCP’s performance, our practical experiments indicate that a modern implementation is significantly more robust to packet reordering than standard TCP and achieves a substantial aggregation benefit even in certain cases of extreme multipath heterogeneity. In addition, we run a large set of emulation-based multipath experiments and identify several TCP parameters that lead to improved multipath performance when correctly tuned. Finally, we present an application-layer solution that builds upon the idea of logical file segmentation for streaming a single video to multihomed clients. The novelity of this approach lies in diverting standard protocol features (i.e., HTTP pipelining and range retrieval requests) from their intended purpose and using them for scheduling video segments over different paths. Interoperable with existing server infrastructure, our proposed solution can be deployed in a lightweight and purely client-based manner. We validate the proposed algorithms by implementing them into an existing video streaming platform.}",
