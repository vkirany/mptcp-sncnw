In this paper, we consider web traffic and evaluate the latency performance of MPTCP compared to TCP with emulations. Our results indicate that MPTCP provides significant gains for websites with large object sizes both for homogeneous and heterogeneous paths. 



%The issues encountered by MPTCP are located at various level and local solutions
%may be provided to solve specific problems. In this paper, we list these
%problems to highlight that improving the performance of MPTCP is a complex task.
%We believe that the deployment of MPTCP must be considered in regards with the
%application profile and the very latest versions of single-path TCP.
