In this paper, we consider web traffic and evaluate the latency performance of MPTCP compared to TCP, both with emulations and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that MPTCP provides significant gains for websites with large object sizes both for homogeneous and heterogeneous paths. Real-world experiment results are mostly consistent with our observations in the emulation environment.



%The issues encountered by MPTCP are located at various level and local solutions
%may be provided to solve specific problems. In this paper, we list these
%problems to highlight that improving the performance of MPTCP is a complex task.
%We believe that the deployment of MPTCP must be considered in regards with the
%application profile and the very latest versions of single-path TCP.
